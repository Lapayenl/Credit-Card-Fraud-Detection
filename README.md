CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The project utilizes a dataset of credit card transactions and applies various data preprocessing and machine learning techniques to build a predictive model.

INTRODUCTION
Credit card fraud detection is a crucial task in the financial industry. This project aims to identify fraudulent transactions using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for this project is highly imbalanced, with a small percentage of fraudulent transactions compared to legitimate ones.

DATASET
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset available on Kaggle. It contains 284,807 transactions, each with 30 features and a class label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

PROJECT STRUCTURE
DoAnMachineLearning.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

RESULTS 
The results of the project, including the performance of various machine learning models, will be displayed in the notebook. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be used to evaluate the models.
